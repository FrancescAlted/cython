This is a reminder for several tasks to be done in documentation.

Long term goal: merge parts of User's Guide into tutorial and
Reference Guide, and then remove it.

* Reference Guide
  * Interfacing with other code: empty
  * Special Mention: empty
  * Limitations: empty
  * Special functions: why not move __iter__ to iterator section?

* Special methods section differs in User's Guide and Reference Guide
  * Syncronize?

* Using C++ in Cython -> move to tutorial?

Tutorial/Further reading:
  * DevList is not updated

Tutorial/Caveats:
  * This does not fit there, I think

Why do not name CEP after their names?:
  http://wiki.cython.org/enhancements/division

Look into using numexpr from Cython.  Frames are not supported in
Cython, so check if that works.
